## (1) Create a vector
Create a random vector that has an even number of elements:
```r
vector1 =  
```
 
## (2) Access values
Access the value in `vector1` this vector with the index
that is half of the length of `vector1`:
```r
vector1[]  
```
  
## (3) Create a matrix
Create a matrix containing 20 random numbers 
(from a uniform distribution), with 4 rows and 5 columns:
```r
matrix1 = matrix()
```

## (4) Calculate
Calculate the mean of each column in `matrix1` 
of each column in `matrix1` and save the result to a new vector:
```r
vector2 = 
```

## (5) Matrix indexing
Take the 3rd row of `matrix1`. Use any two values in the 
resulting vector and multiply these values with any two
values in `vector2`:
```r
matrix1[] * vectro2[]
```

# (6) Remove columns
Remove columns the last column in matrix1 and save the resulting matrix:
```r
matrix2 = matrix1[]
```
 
# (7) Create a new column 
Create a new column in matrix2, as a sum of all rows in matrix2:
```r
matrix2 = cbind()
```

# (8) Load data
Load the Orange data:
```r
data()
```

# (9) Calculate summary:
Calculate the summary of this data:
```r
```

# (10) Save data to disk
Save the Orange data to disk with a new name, as a tab-separated file:
```r
```
